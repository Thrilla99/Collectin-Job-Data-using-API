# Collecting Jobs Data Using APIs

## Overview
This project is part of the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate.  
The goal was to collect job postings data from an API, analyze it using Python, and save the results into an Excel spreadsheet.

## Files
- Jobs_API.ipynb: Supporting notebook with code to run before starting the lab
- Collecting_job_data_using_APIs-Lab.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the code and outputs
- job-postings.xlsx: Excel file with the summarized job counts by technology and location  

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository
2. Open the notebook in Jupyter or Watson Studio  
3. Run all cells to reproduce the analysis  
4. Review the Excel file `job-postings.xlsx` for the results

## Results
The notebook demonstrates how to access JSON data using an API, process it with Python, and export job counts by technology and location into an Excel file.
